# Micro-ONOS Revamped

As far as I know, the Atomix framework for distributed system, which is used in Traditional ONOS (Java version) and Micro-ONOS (Go version) has some good idea with the raft protocol and distributed storage. However, from what I see from the current state of the Atomix codes, it's an unfinished hot mess with little public document and community works. However, as far as I know, the developers of ONOS still uses it as its storage framework.

Project _ÂµONOS Revamped_ aims at replacing Atomix with Hazelcast, a framework which is still active, has better community support and more features.

Sorry, Atomix, you might have some good idea, but as of now, you're a piece of sh** !

Anyway, [here's](https://github.com/micro-onos-revamped) the github for my project !
